# 🚗 Image Classification with Neural Networks

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project builds a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to classify images from the popular **CIFAR-10** dataset. The model learns to identify 10 different classes like Plane, Car, Bird, Cat, and more.

You can:
- Train the CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Evaluate model accuracy on unseen test images.
- Load any custom image and predict its class using the trained model.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- **Data Normalization:** Scales pixel values to improve training.
- **Deep CNN Architecture:** Multiple Conv2D and MaxPooling layers.
- **Visualization:** Display sample images and prediction results.
- **Model Saving & Loading:** Save model in Keras `.keras` format and reuse anytime.
- **Custom Image Prediction:** Predict class for any input image resized to 32x32.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib opencv-python
````

### How to Run

1. Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/annahunn20/image-classification-cnn.git
cd image-classification-cnn
```

2. Run the training and testing script:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Add your image named `car.jpg` in the project folder to test custom image prediction.
